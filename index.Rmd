## Overview

Here is a dummy website with table of contents and web apps! I can easily modify the appearnace as you like or add a CSS file that Michelle generates to modify the appearance. Note that it is also possible to set up to render this document to a website hosted by GitHub, and then you can just point everybody there. I can also generate the elements statically, and you can hand them off to Michelle. Up to you!

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
